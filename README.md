# Learning Front End by Doing Course '50 Projects In 50 Days'

## Description

This will be 50 mini HTML, CSS and JavaScript projects that I will do on my path to become a Front End Web Developer.
The projects will be done according to the [Udemy Course '50 Projects In 50 Days'](https://www.udemy.com/course/50-projects-50-days) by [Traversy Media](https://traversymedia.com).

To make the most of the course first I will try to make the Project by myself after watching only the project intro video. Then I will watch video lesons how Brad is doing, compare it to my work and do corrections to my work if needed.
